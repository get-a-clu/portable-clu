In solaris 5.8, the garbage collector has trouble figuring out
where the bottom of the stack is.  So far the following fix has
been useful.

Add the following line
		GC_stackbottom = 0xffbf0000;
to
		pclu/code/gc/test.c
		pclu/code/gc/cord/cordtest.c
		pclu/code/sysasm/Opt/util.c
at the beginning of the main routine.
I think cordtest.c also needs
	extern char *GC_stackbottom;
